C++/Native library (windows only under Visual Studio) for Serial Communication (Serial over USB, CDC and regular UART) with goodies currently available only in .NET (Easy port enumeration with friendly names, USB connection and disconnection events etc.)
The library is currently under construction. Help is very much epreciated.
